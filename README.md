User Dashboard is an Odin Project assignment challenging students to create a dashboard webpage using this image as reference:
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png. The purpose of this assignment was to create the dashboard using the CSS grid layout system.

My goal with this assignment was to make my dashboard very close in resemblance to the reference image. For this page, I used several nested grid and flexbox layout properties to achieve my desired layout. I found this assignment to be a great way to practice using the grid layout property in CSS.
